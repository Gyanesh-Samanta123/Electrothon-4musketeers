## Background üìñ

India is home to more than 20 E-commerce websites, and is considered one of the countries in which youth and children comprise more than 55% of the population. With daily orders pouring in over 300 thousand in number, the market of online shoppers is increasing everyday. Within this population about 45% of all orders placed are for garments and fashion. 

With this huge market in mind, it is essential to tap into the demographic and increase it many folds further. 


## About Our project üîß
### What
**Our project** is a Web Application that enables it's user to view different garments available online, and to view different colours available for them.  

### Why
We do not really have platforms which allow people to choose their tshirts or jeans in different colours, the photographers have to take extra steps to ensure that they click pictures of every available colour option to present it to people, what if there was a way to directly enter hex codes, or choose colour from a pallete and have it delivered to your home? So with this problem statement in mind, we designed our web-app. 

### How
With a super simple User Interface, we make choosing your favorite colour easy. Under the hood, we have a really simple web-app, resembling the most popular E-Commerce websites and user familiarity. We hope that anyone would be able to use our web app without any former knowledge about it.
